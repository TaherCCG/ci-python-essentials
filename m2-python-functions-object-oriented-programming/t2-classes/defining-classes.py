# Defining Classes in Python

"""
Python is known as an object-oriented language, which means it has first-class support for classes. Unlike some other languages, 
for instance, Java, you’re not forced to use classes, as you can see by the fact that we haven’t used classes in any of the other 
units. Python is also known as mixed-paradigm language in that you can use either a functional or object-orientated style. Classes 
are a good way of combining data and methods and are useful when dealing with hierarchies. They are generally used to model more 
complex data types which can’t be modelled using Python’s built-in data structures such as lists and dicts.


We define a class by using the class keyword followed by the name. Like functions, a class does not do anything until it is executed.
Scope also applies to classes so global and nonlocal scope have to be taken into consideration. A class name should start with a 
capital letter and should have a docstring. Classes can contain functions and other statements.

class HelloWorld:

"""A simple example class"""
i = 12345
def f(self):
    return 'Hello, world!'
