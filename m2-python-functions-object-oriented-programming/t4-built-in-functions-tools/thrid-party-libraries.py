# Third Party Libraries

"""In addition to the built-in libraries, as Python is open source, anyone can create software and share it with the community.
A library is a collection of modules that have some common functionality. There is a Python Package Index (pypi.org) where these 
open source projects are shared.

library
In the runnable example, we are using a third-party library named numpy. It is a widely used library for scientific computing. 
We can give the package name an alias (np in this case), so we donâ€™t have to type it out each time. Numpy extends the abilities 
of Python into scientific computing. Here we are creating a simple one-dimensional array. The repl.it already has numpy installed.
If you were trying this on your computer, you would have to install numpy locally as it is a third-party library rather than a 
built-in library installed with Python.

# Runnable example:

import numpy as np 

a = np.array([1, 2, 3])

print(a)
