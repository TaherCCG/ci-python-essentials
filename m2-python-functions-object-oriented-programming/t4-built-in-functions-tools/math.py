# Math
"""
Python has a plethora of built-in libraries for everyday tasks. One of the most useful is Math. If you need to do a calculation in your code,
then it is a good idea to import from this library, rather than reinventing the wheel.

The Math library contains a number of mathematical functions. For example, you can use the Math library to calculate the value of Pi or the 
square root of a number.

Buil-in Functions-
Working with Math

Math.PI is a constant that represents the value of Pi. You can use it in your code to calculate the circumference of a circle or the area of a circle.

Math.random() is a function that generates a random number between 0 and 1. You can use it in your code to generate random numbers.

Math.abs() is a function that returns the absolute value of a number. You can use it in your code to get the absolute value of a number.

Math.min() is a function that returns the smallest of the numbers passed to it. You can use it in your code to find the smallest number in a list of numbers.

Math.max() is a function that returns the largest of the numbers passed to it. You can use it in your code to find the largest number in a list of numbers.

Math.sqrt() is a function that returns the square root of a number. You can use it in your code to find the square root of a number.

Math.pow() is a function that returns the value of a number raised to the power of another number. You can use it in your code to calculate the value of a number raised to the power of another number.

Math.floor() is a function that returns the largest integer less than or equal to a number. You can use it in your code to round a number down to the nearest integer.

Math.ceil() is a function that returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a number. You can use it in your code to round a number up to the nearest integer.

Math.round() is a function that returns the value of a number rounded to the nearest integer. You can use it in your code to round a number to the nearest integer.

Math.sin() is a function that returns the sine of a number. You can use it in your code to calculate the sine of a number.

Math.cos() is a function that returns the cosine of a number. You can use it in your code to calculate the cosine of a number.

Math.tan() is a function that returns the tangent of a number. You can use it in your code to calculate the tangent of a number.

Math.asin() is a function that returns the arcsine of a number. You can use it in your code to calculate the arcsine of a number.

Math.acos() is a function that returns the arccosine of a number. You can use it in your code to calculate the arccosine of a number.

Math.atan() is a function that returns the arctangent of a number. You can use it in your code to calculate the arctangent of a number.

Math.log() is a function that returns the natural logarithm of a number. You can use it in your code to calculate the natural logarithm of a number.

Math.exp() is a function that returns e raised to the power of a number. You can use it in your code to calculate e raised to the power of a number.
