else:

# Output: a has not got the same value as b

"""
In this challenge, you need to write an if-else statement to compare the values of two variables a and b.
If the values of a and b are equal, the result should be 'a has the same value as b'.
If the values of a and b are not equal, the result should be 'a has not got the same value as b'.
