# List comprehension

""" List comprehension is a concise way to create lists. It is a way to create a new list by 
applying an expression to each item in an existing list. 

It is commonly used where you want to generate a list based on an operation or to create a new sub-list of an existing list.

# Let's compare the list comprehension syntax with what youâ€™ve seen before.

numbers = []
for x in range(10):
    numbers.append(x)
# This same code could be written as a list comprehension.

numbers = [x for x in range(10)]
# This is a more straightforward cleaner way to write the list. The list comprehension can also include additional logic. Here's a much more complex example.

combination = []
for x in [1,2,3]:
    for y in [3,1,4]:
        if x != y:
            combination.append((x,y))
# This code returns [(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)] which is a list of tuples.This can be done in one line:

combination = [(x, y) for x in [1,2,3] for y in [3,1,4] if x != y]

# The list comprehension is a powerful tool that can be used to create lists in a concise way. 
# It is a great way to create lists based on an operation or to create a new sub-list of an existing list.
