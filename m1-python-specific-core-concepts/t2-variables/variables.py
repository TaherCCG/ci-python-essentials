Variables in Python
Variables in Python are used to store data. 
In Python, variables are created when a value is assigned to them. 
Variables are used to store data that can be accessed and manipulated later in the program. 
Variables in Python are case-sensitive, which means that the variable name 'age' is different from 'Age'. 
Variables in Python can store different types of data, such as integers, strings, lists, and dictionaries. 
Variables in Python can also be reassigned to different values.
